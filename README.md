- 👋 Hi, I’m @AMarieP
- 👀 I’m interested in geting better at coding in general and reaching a point where I could work in web development!
- I have a BDes in fashion & minor in Digital Fabrication, I find that code scratches a similar itch in my brain to designing and pattern making
- 🌱 I’m currently doing a diploma in Web Design, learning JS/React & trying to familiarize myself with the industry 
- 💞️ I’m always looking for new ways to learn and grow
- 📫 How to reach me ...
